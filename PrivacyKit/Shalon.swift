/**
	With this class you can connect to a target through a
	[Shalon](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235258) proxy. Connections to
	the proxy and connections to the target will each be encrypted using TLS.
	This means that your ISP or other people in your network cannot observe to
	which target you connect, because they only see connections to the proxy.
	The proxy itself does not see the content of your requests to the target.
	The target will only see the proxy's IP address (except if the IP address is
	otherwise embedded into the request).

	This implementation supports multiple hops. Simply add other layers.

	In order to use Shalon proxies with your `URLSession` connections, please
	take look at `ShalonURLProtocol`.

	## Examples

	```swift
	let proxy1 = Target(withHostname: "shalon1.jondonym.net", andPort: 443)!
	let proxy2 = Target(withHostname: "shalon2.jondonym.net", andPort: 443)!
	let proxy3 = Target(withHostname: "shalon3.jondonym.net", andPort: 443)!
	let target = Target(withHostname: "www.example.com", andPort: 443)!

	let shalon = Shalon(withTarget: target)

	shalon.addLayer(proxy3)
	shalon.addLayer(proxy2)
	shalon.addLayer(proxy1)

	shalon.issue(request: Request(withMethod: .head, andUrl: url)!) {
	    optionalResponse, optionalError in
	    // TODO Do something
	}
	```

	This will establish a nested tunnel, where `proxy1` cannot see what the
	`client` sends to `proxy2`, as depicted:

	```
	client           proxy1           proxy2           proxy3          target
	|                |                |                |               |
